This directory provides Amulet tests that focus on verification of
rabbitmq-server basic deployments.

test_* methods are called in lexical sort order, although each individual test
should be idempotent, and expected to pass regardless of run order.

Test name convention to ensure desired test order:
    1xx service and endpoint checks
    2xx relation checks
    3xx config checks
    4xx functional checks
    9xx restarts and other final checks
